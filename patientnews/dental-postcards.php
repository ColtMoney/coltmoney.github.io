                        one of the most trackable mediums. If you think postcards would work best for your market area,
                        test it out using proven methods to determine what’s best for you. At Patient News, we can
                        provide you with a variety of direct mail solutions, including dental postcards, patient
                        newsletters, and brochures.</p>

                    <p>It’s proven that customer advocacy increases when businesses respond to a review. For example,
                        Yelp users are 33% more likely to upgrade their review if a business responds with a personal
                        message. Likewise, if a negative review is ignored, advocacy goes down.</p>
                    <h3 class="s_title">When it comes to attracting more new patients to your dental practice,
                        newsletters crush postcards...</h3>
                    <p>... for response and return on investment (ROI).</p>
                    <p>While postcards may seem like a natural choice, they’re really only around because they’re easy –
                        not because they drive the best return on investment. They don’t require an editorial, research,
                        and writing board (which we’ve invested in at Patient News). And postcards may seem easy for you
                        – logo, headline, and offer ... and you’re done.</p>
                    <p>Dental postcards are perceived to be less expensive. However in an extensive study, in 300
                        markets, we pitted our beautiful and highly customized postcards directly against our
                        newsletters – same content, same offers – and newsletters significantly outpulled postcards.
                        It’s proven. We can sell you either solution but we know newsletters are better.</p>
