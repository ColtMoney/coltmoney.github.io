                <p>
                    1. With this dashboard, you know everything that’s going on with your practice marketing, and way more than you even have time to look at. It’s incredible. I have worked with a lot of companies that didn’t even have 10% of the stats Patient News gives you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    2. Call Tracking & Call Scoring helps to get the calls coming in, and also (and just as important), Patient News trained us on how to convert calls.
                </p>
                <p>
                    3. Phone Power Video Training & Scripts were crucial and invaluable and training helped us excel at converting calls – it’s greatly increased.
                </p>
                <p>
                    4. Demographic Analysis & List Development helped us target quality patients who usually walk in with their flyers in hand (they definitely keep them!). The new patients are very high-quality who refer other quality patients. Most have not seen a dentist in quite some time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    5. The best thing about working with Patient News is that they have the best customer service of any marketing company, hands down. They are incredibly thorough.
                </p>
                <p>
                    6. Our best tip to book more new-patient appointments is to focus on the problem or concern, assure patients that they are in good hands, and get them in the door right away.
                </p>
                <p>
                    7. The offers patients have responded to most are no-charge consults.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you are looking to grow your practice with new patients who will be long-term quality patients, I can’t imagine a better marketing strategy than one from Patient News. There’s no way you will not win. Numbers

                <p>
                    Our biggest challenge was getting our name out there so patients were aware that we were in the neighborhood. We also really needed to increase our new- patient flow. Before we started with Patient News, we were seeing 10-20 new patients a month, which was not enough to grow the practice.

                <p>
                    • The best thing I ever purchased for the practice is my intraoral camera.
                </p>
                <p>
                    • The biggest influence on my decision to become a dentist was that I had a great pediatric dentist when I was a kid. Also, I had close friends in college who were pre-dental.
                </p>
                <p>
                    • The best thing about being a dentist is being able to make a positive change in someone’s life and see their confidence improve.
                </p>
                <p>
                    • The worst thing about being a dentist is back strain.
                </p>
                <p>
                    • Younger dentists today should focus on mastering their craft. Take CE on full-mouth reconstruction, occlusion, implants, etc. Master your skills so you can be the best, most-productive dentist possible for your career and your patients.
                </p>
                <p>
                    • The last books I read were How To Win Friends And Influence People; The Personal MBA; Dentistry’s Business Secrets; Change Your Questions, Change Your Life; Everything is Marketing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    • The CE courses I took in 2017 and 2018 were the Misch Surgical Implant Program, Implant Complications, Clinical Master Ultimate Occlusion, Live Aesthetics in the Op, Oral Sedation Implant Seminars, business masters course, Biohorizons Teeth Express.
                </p>
                <p>
                    • When not practicing dentistry, I love to relax and fish on my boat!

                    The investments I’ve made that pay the most have been CE and good marketing that gets patients to call to your practice. So far, hands down, the Patient News newsletters have provided the best results – a phenomenal way to build your patient base and bring quality new patients in the door.
